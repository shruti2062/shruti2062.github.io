    title: About Me
    icon: fas fa-user
    description: I am currently pursuing Ph.D. in the field of nanoscience and technology, focusing on the synthesis and characterization of Carbon Quantum Dots (CQDs) using cost-effective techniques with various non-toxic green and organic precursors. To enhance their efficiency and stability, these CQDs are capped with organic polymers. My research explores their applications in nanosensors, bioimaging, and light-emitting devices.  Additionally, I validate my experimental findings through Density Functional Theory (DFT) simulations using Gaussian software. I have published eight research papers, including six as the first author in reputed journals, and have presented my work at multiple national and international conferences.

        description: Data Analysis on Time-of-Flight study from the data files of Fermilab's to find Muon's Speed during International Muon Week. In this project we used the data of stacked detectors in Fermilab Location- Batavia, Illinois [ latitude- 41:52.193794 N, longitude- 087:38.902188 W (same for both)] which are placed at different positions upon each other. We determined the speed by calculating the inverse of the slopes of the best fit lines in scatter plots (where the independent variable is separation(m) and the dependent variable is mean traversal time (ns)). We compared our results for different pair of detectors. Looking at our results ,we concluded with our hypothesis to be true where muon speeds are found to be close to speed of light.
